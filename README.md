## AI Task: Complete README Transformation

Hello Cursor AI! Your task is to COMPLETELY REWRITE this README with a comprehensive project implementation guide.

### Critical Requirements:

1. **FULLY REWRITE this entire README** - create a detailed, production-ready guide while maintaining the core project concept
2. **Create a DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP PLAN (max 8 steps)** that covers:
   - Environment setup with all required technologies
   - Project structure creation
   - Implementation of core features
   - Testing and deployment approaches
3. **Tailor content to the user's profile:**
   - User's Experience Level: `Beginner`
   - User's Available Time: `A Few Days`
4. **For each technology listed**, provide:
   - Specific implementation details
   - Best practices and patterns
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
5. **Add detailed sections for:**
   - Architecture diagram or description
   - Database schema (if applicable)
   - API endpoints (if applicable)
   - Component structure (for frontend)
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment instructions
6. **Provide code examples** for critical project parts
7. **REMOVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY** after your rewrite

Your goal is to transform this outline into a comprehensive roadmap that makes this project immediately actionable based on the user's specific experience level and time constraints.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FIRST STEP ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOUR FIRST AND ONLY TASK UPON RECEIVING THIS README IS TO REWRITE IT COMPLETELY. DO NOT START IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT OR WRITING ANY CODE YET.**

The user will explicitly ask you to begin implementation AFTER you have rewritten and improved this README.

# General Knowledge Mini Quiz with Leaderboard

## Project Overview
Create a web-based mini quiz that allows users to compete against each other in general knowledge questions, with a leaderboard to display the top scorers.


> **üí° Quick Start:** After cloning this repository and opening it in Cursor, simply tell the AI: "Read the README and guide me through implementing this project step by step." Cursor AI will analyze the requirements and help you build each feature.


## User Profile
- **Experience Level:** Beginner
- **Available Time to Complete:** A Few Days

## Technologies
- **HTML**: Used for structuring and organizing content on the web page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and layout of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Used for creating interactive elements, handling user input, and updating the leaderboard.
- **React**: Used as the front-end framework to build reusable UI components and manage state changes.
- **Redux**: Used as the state management library to store and update the quiz questions and user scores.
- **Firebase**: Used as the backend service to store and retrieve quiz questions, user scores, and leaderboard data.
- **Material-UI**: Used for providing pre-designed UI components and layouts to speed up development.


## Development Steps
### 1. Set up the Project Structure
Create a new React project using create-react-app, and set up the basic file structure and folders.

### 2. Design the Quiz Component
Create a React component to display the quiz questions, options, and user input fields.

### 3. Implement Question Logic
Write JavaScript functions to handle user input, validate answers, and update the score.

### 4. Integrate with Firebase
Set up Firebase as the backend service to store and retrieve quiz questions, user scores, and leaderboard data.

### 5. Create the Leaderboard
Design and implement the leaderboard component to display the top scorers.

### 6. Style the Application
Use CSS and Material-UI to style the quiz and leaderboard components.

### 7. Test and Debug
Test the application, debug any issues, and ensure everything works as expected.

### 8. Deploy the Application
Deploy the application to a hosting platform, such as Firebase Hosting or Vercel.


## Main Features
Features will be added soon


## Sample Code
```javascript
// Example code snippet
function handleAnswerSubmission(answer) {
  if (answer === correctAnswer) {
    updateScore();
  }
}
```


## Getting Started
Instructions will be added soon

## Resources
- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) (documentation)
- [Redux Tutorial](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview) (tutorial)
- [Firebase Realtime Database Tutorial](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start) (tutorial)
- [Material-UI Documentation](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) (documentation)


## AI Coding Prompts

Here are some prompts you can use with AI coding assistants like Cursor or GitHub Copilot to help implement this project:

### Prompt 1
```
Create a React component that displays the quiz question and allows users to submit answers. Use Material-UI to design the component and React hooks to manage state. For example, create a state variable to store the current question and another to store the user's score.
```

### Prompt 2
```
Implement the logic for updating the user's score when they submit an answer. Use Redux to dispatch an action to update the state, and update the leaderboard accordingly. For example, write a Redux action creator to update the user's score and another to update the leaderboard data in Firebase.
```

### Prompt 3
```
Enhance the quiz by adding features like timer, question difficulty levels, and a 'Hint' button. Use Firebase Realtime Database to store and retrieve quiz questions, user scores, and leaderboard data. For example, create a function to generate a random question based on the user's difficulty level and another to display a hint for a specific question.
```


Copy and paste these prompts into your AI coding assistant to get started with development.
